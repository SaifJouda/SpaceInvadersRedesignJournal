Interactives for Unity require a live server to work (You CANNOT just open the html file). 
Here are the steps to open the site:
1. Open Visual Studio Code (here is a link to download it if you dont have it: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview )
2. Download the live server addon for VSCode, here is a link to it: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer#:~:text=Shortcuts%20to%20Start%2FStop%20Server&text=Open%20the%20Command%20Pallete%20by,Server%20to%20stop%20a%20server.
  - Visit the site
  - Press "install" this should prompt a pop up and ask you to open in visual studio code 
  - Press the addon and it should open VSCode where u can download the add-on

  - Press on the "Go Live" button  near the bottom right of the screen, or follow any one of the 5 ways listed on the download site of the add-on to open the live server, doing so will open the interactive site
